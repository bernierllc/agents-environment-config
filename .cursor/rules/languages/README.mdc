## Python

- `style.mdc` - PEP 8, Black formatting, type hints, code organization

## TypeScript

- `typing-standards.mdc` - TypeScript typing standards, strict mode, no any

## Usage

These rules apply automatically when files matching the glob patterns are present. See individual rule files for specific glob patterns.
