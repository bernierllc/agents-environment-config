# Cursor Rules Index

## Overview
This directory follows a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) structure to make rules discoverable and scoped by concern. High-level categories are: general, languages, stacks, frameworks, topics, and packages.

## Global vs Project-Specific Rules

**This repository contains global rules** that apply across all projects. These rules cover:

- General patterns and standards
- Language-specific conventions (TypeScript, Python)
- Framework standards (Next.js, FastAPI, React Native)
- Cross-cutting topics (API design, Git workflow, security, quality)
- Testing and accessibility standards

**Project-specific rules** should remain in their respective projects (e.g., `my-project/.cursor/rules/`) and should:

- Reference global rules where applicable
- Focus on project-specific patterns and business logic
- Avoid duplicating global standards

**How it works**: Cursor IDE automatically discovers rules in parent directories. When this repository is in your workspace path, Cursor will apply these global rules alongside project-specific rules (project rules take precedence for conflicts).

For architecture details, see `plans/cursor/architecture.md`.

## Structure

### general/
Always-apply rules that apply universally across all projects:
- `architecture.mdc` - Core architectural principles and design philosophy
- `development-workflow.mdc` - Version control, code quality, and development environment standards
- `documentation.mdc` - Documentation standards, file organization, and content guidelines
- `security.mdc` - Security standards, authentication, authorization, and data protection
- `port-management.mdc` - Centralized port management system to prevent conflicts
- `project-setup-cli.mdc` - Project Setup CLI tool usage for consistent environments
- `plans-checklists.mdc` - Plans and checklist usage standards
- `rules-about-rules.mdc` - Rules for managing and maintaining cursor rules files

### languages/
Language-specific rules (apply when working with these languages):
- `python/style.mdc` - PEP 8, Black formatting, type hints, code organization
- `typescript/typing-standards.mdc` - TypeScript typing standards, strict mode, no any

### stacks/
Stack-specific rules (apply when using these technology stacks):
- `nextjs/app-router.mdc` - Next.js App Router patterns, React component standards
- `react-native/expo-development.mdc` - React Native and Expo development guidelines
- `python-backend/fastapi.mdc` - FastAPI patterns and conventions

### frameworks/
Framework/tool-specific rules:
- `database/` - Database frameworks
  - `prisma.mdc` - Prisma database patterns for Next.js/TypeScript
  - `supabase.mdc` - Supabase development guidelines and patterns
  - `sqlalchemy.mdc` - SQLAlchemy patterns and conventions
  - `alembic.mdc` - Alembic migration patterns for Python
- `ui/` - UI frameworks
  - `tailwind-css.mdc` - Tailwind CSS styling standards
  - `tamagui.mdc` - Tamagui property mappings and component development
- `testing/` - Testing frameworks
  - `standards.mdc` - Testing standards - no mocking of internal systems
  - `organization.mdc` - Test organization, file layout, coverage targets
  - `tools.mdc` - Testing tools and commands

### topics/
Cross-cutting topic rules:
- `api/design-standards.mdc` - API design standards, HTTP status codes, error handling
- `git/workflow.mdc` - Git branching strategy, commit conventions, pull request workflow
- `security/` - Security topics
  - `authentication.mdc` - Authentication boundaries and user identification
  - `secrets.mdc` - Secrets management and environment variables
- `quality/` - Quality and standards
  - `gates.mdc` - Quality gates and standards for code quality and production readiness
  - `error-handling.mdc` - Error handling patterns and zero-error policy
  - `logging.mdc` - Logging standards and logger usage patterns
- `accessibility/standards.mdc` - Accessibility standards and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- `deployment/environments.mdc` - Deployment workflow and environment management
- `observability/monitoring.mdc` - Observability, monitoring, and logging patterns
- `troubleshooting/debugging.mdc` - Troubleshooting patterns and debugging guidelines

### packages/
Package-specific rules (for tools/):
- `package-management.mdc` - Package management rules using ./manager CLI
- `package-reuse.mdc` - Guidelines for reusing existing packages

## Usage Guidelines
- Read relevant rules in your scope before work
- Follow standards; propose edits when reality changes
- Prefer linking to detailed docs in `/docs/`
- **For projects**: Reference global rules, don't duplicate them. Keep only project-specific patterns.

## Notes
- Testing standards: If we own it or write it, we test it directly - no mocking. Only external third-party services can be mocked. See `frameworks/testing/standards.mdc`.
- All general rules have `alwaysApply: true` and will be applied to all projects.
- Framework, language, and stack-specific rules have appropriate globs and will apply when matching files are present.
- **Architecture**: Global rules (this repo) + Project-specific rules (in each project) = Complete rule set
