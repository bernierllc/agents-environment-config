# Rules About Rules

## Core Principle
Rules are living documents and should be updated as we learn. Suggest improvements when something is unclear or not working. Keep rules concise and merge overlapping rules where possible.

## Global vs Project-Specific Rules

### Global Rules (This Repository)

These rules in `agents-environment-config/.cursor/rules/` are **global rules** that apply across all projects. They contain:

- General patterns and standards that work across projects
- Language-specific conventions (TypeScript, Python)
- Framework standards (Next.js, FastAPI, React Native)
- Cross-cutting topics (API design, Git workflow, security, quality)

**Location**: `agents-environment-config/.cursor/rules/`

### Project-Specific Rules

Project-specific rules stay in their respective projects (`{project}/.cursor/rules/`) and should:

- Focus on project-specific patterns and business logic
- Reference global rules where applicable (avoid duplication)
- Handle custom workflows unique to that project

**Location**: `{project}/.cursor/rules/`

**How Cursor applies them**: Cursor discovers rules in parent directories, so global rules apply automatically. Project-specific rules take precedence for conflicts. Both rule sets complement each other.

For detailed architecture, see `plans/cursor/architecture.md`.

## Guidelines for Rule Files

### Structure
- Prefer small, focused rules with clear intent
- Keep terminology consistent across all rules
- When multiple files cover the same topic, consolidate into one and deprecate the rest

### Content Standards
- Prefer active voice and imperative style ("Do X", "Avoid Y")
- Fix typos immediately; clear language beats clever phrasing
- Use short rationale lines for non-obvious rules (1–2 sentences max)

### Maintenance Process
- When you change behavior or standards, submit an edit to the relevant rule file in the same PR
- When adopting a new convention, add it to the appropriate rule file and reference related docs in `/docs/`
- Link to decisions or plans in `./plans/` when context helps future readers
- Run linting before committing rule changes to ensure formatting stays consistent

### Conflict Resolution
- If a rule conflicts with reality, propose an update rather than a workaround
- Rules should reflect actual practices, not aspirational goals
- Update rules when practices change

### Documentation
- When adopting a new convention, add it to the appropriate rule file and reference related docs in `/docs/`
- Link to decisions or plans in `./plans/` when context helps future readers
- Cross-reference related rules appropriately
