# Error Handling

## Core Requirements

### Zero Error Policy
- **Never commit with errors**: Always fix issues before committing
- **No TypeScript errors**: `npm run type-check` must pass
- **No linting errors**: `npm run lint` must pass
- **No testing errors**: All tests must pass
- **Build must succeed**: `npm run build` must complete successfully

### Pre-commit Validation
- Use pre-commit hooks to catch errors early
- Run all checks locally before pushing
- Don't rely on CI to catch issues
- Fix errors immediately when they appear

## Error Categories

### TypeScript Errors
- Compilation errors must be resolved
- Type safety issues must be fixed
- Interface mismatches must be corrected
- Import/export errors must be resolved

### Linting Errors
- ESLint violations must be fixed
- Code style issues must be resolved
- Unused variables must be removed
- Import/export consistency must be maintained

### Testing Errors
- All unit tests must pass
- Integration tests must pass
- No test failures allowed
- Test coverage requirements must be met

## Error Resolution Workflow

1. **Identify the Error** - Read error message carefully, understand root cause
2. **Fix the Error** - Apply minimal fix needed, test locally
3. **Verify the Fix** - Run type-check, lint, test, build
4. **Commit the Fix** - Use conventional commit messages

## Quality Gates

### Before Every Commit
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] No console errors
