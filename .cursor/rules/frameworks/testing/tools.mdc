# Testing Tools & Commands

## Runners & Libraries
- Unit/Integration: Vitest / Jest + Testing Library
- E2E: Playwright (preferred) or Cypress
- Contract tests: Pact, OpenAPI validators, Zod/JSON Schema

## Suggested Commands
```bash
# Run fast unit/integration tests
pnpm test:run

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# E2E suite
pnpm test:e2e

# Contract tests (example)
pnpm test:contracts
```

## Guardrails
- Lint/typecheck pre-commit; full suite pre-push
- Keep test output deterministic; avoid real clocks unless essential
